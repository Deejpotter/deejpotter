  <h2>I love technology</h2>
  <p>I have always had a love for technology. Since I can remember I have been learning about every
    electronic device I could get my hands on.</p>
  <p>I grew up with the internet so I have had a lot of time
    to figure out how it works and I also love sharing my knowledge with other people. I’m always happy
    to help someone who needs it and if I can practice my skills at the same time, even better.</p>

  <h2>I love learning</h2>
  <p>I completed a certificate in IT in 2013 but most of what I know about web design has been self-taught.
    To be honest, the rules and practices change so often that any good web developer should be self-taught.</p>
  <p>I have also used online courses for the trickier stuff.</p>

  <h2>I love my family</h2>
  <p>My family is really important to me. I am married and I have 3 kids.</p>
  <p>If I have any spare time I enjoy making and playing video games as well as learning about science and
    philosophy.</p>
  <p>Although, most of the time when I’m not working I’m studying to make better websites because there is so much to
    learn.</p>

  <h2>I love helping people</h2>
  <p>If you want to know anything else about me just send me a message. I'd love to answer your questions.</p>
