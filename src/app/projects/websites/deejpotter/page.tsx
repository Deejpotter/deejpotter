        This is my personal website, the one you&apos;re on right now! I made it
        using Next.js and Bootstrap.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main purpose of this website is to showcase my projects and to
        provide a way for people to contact me.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also has a blog where I write about things that I find interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used Next.js because it&apos;s a great framework for building websites
        and it&apos;s easy to use for a developer like me who is familiar with
        React.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
