# Deej Potter's Portfolio

Hi, I'm Daniel, or Deej, a full-stack developer who used to be a chef. This is the repo for my portfolio website, which I've built with Next.js.

## A Bit About Me

I started out working in my parents' restaurant, but I've always been more interested in tech. I eventually started a web design business from home, which led me to dive deeper into coding and become a full-stack developer.

## This Project

This portfolio website is my playground where I get to showcase my coding projects and talk about my journey in tech. Here's what you'll find:

1. **About Page**: Just a bit about me and how I ended up in the tech world.
2. **Contact Page**: A simple contact form built with Netlify Forms. Feel free to drop me a line!
3. **Website Projects**: Some of the websites I've built. I've used Netlify CMS to manage the content.
4. **Games**: I've made a few WebGL games, which I've showcased here.
5. **Technical Apps**: Here, I've showcased some technical apps with dynamic functionality that I've built.
6. **Engineering Projects**: A section dedicated to engineering projects, including the "Wireless Car" project.
7. **Privacy and Terms**: Pages outlining the privacy policy and terms of service.

I initially built this project with Angular, but I've recently migrated it to Next.js for the SSG SEO benefits. I'm using Netlify CMS for content management, Netlify Forms for the contact form, and Netlify Identity for user authentication. I'm also using Netlify Functions to handle dynamic functionality. And, it's hosted on Netlify, of course.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Next.js**: The main framework used for building the website.
- **Netlify CMS**: For managing the content of the website.
- **Netlify Forms**: For handling the contact form submissions.
- **Netlify Identity**: For user authentication.
- **Netlify Functions**: For handling dynamic functionality.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling the website.
- **React**: For building the user interface components.

Feel free to poke around the code. If you're curious about anything or just want to chat about coding, don't hesitate to reach out!
