# Deejpotter

I found my passion for writing code around 2013 and since then it has become my favourite hobby and hopefully it will be my favourite career. 

My favourite things to do are web application development and object-oriented programming.

I'm also interested in other areas of technology such as game development, web and game design, UX design, 3D modeling, and even filling in spreadsheets.

Look at all my cool projects in style, once I get my site done.
