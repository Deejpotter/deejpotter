# Project TODOs for Deej Potter Portfolio

## Overview

A concise, actionable roadmap to clean up the repo, migrate off Netlify, strengthen CI/CD, improve testing, documentation, security, and performance. All tasks are listed in this file so they appear in the GitHub UI and can be tracked via Issues/Projects.

## Detailed Plan and Sub‑steps

### 1️⃣ Clean & Streamline the Build Stack

- **1.1 Remove unused Babel tooling**
  - Run yarn remove @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @babel/preset-typescript @babel/helpers @babel/runtime.
  - Verify package.json no longer lists any @babel/* packages.
- **1.2 Drop Bootstrap & legacy CSS**
  - Search for bootstrap imports (git grep bootstrap src).
  - Replace UI components with Tailwind equivalents or delete them.
  - Run yarn remove bootstrap @types/bootstrap.
- **1.3 Clean ESLint config**
  - Remove eslint-plugin-react-hooks (yarn remove eslint-plugin-react-hooks).
  - Keep only eslint-config-next and @typescript-eslint/*.
- **1.4 (Optional) Migrate to Yarn Berry**
  - Run yarn set version berry.
  - Commit .yarnrc.yml and update engines in package.json.

### 2️⃣ Harden the Netlify Migration

- **2.1 Create migration folder & docs**
  - mkdir -p migration && touch migration/netlify-to-route-handlers.md migration/cms-to-mdx.md migration/forms-to-api-routes.md.
  - Populate each with a brief description and checklist.
- **2.2 Add a GitHub Project board** (optional manual step).
- **2.3 Add a helper script to list Netlify‑specific files**
  Create scripts/list-netlify-files.js with:
  import { shell } from "developer";
  const files = shell({ command: "git ls-files | grep netlify" });
  console.log(files);

### 3️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

- **3.1 Create .github/workflows/ci.yml** with steps for install, lint, type‑check, test (Vitest coverage), build, and upload artifacts.
- **3.2 Add CI badge to README**.
- **3.3 Optional CI enhancements** – deploy‑preview workflow, Dependabot config (.github/dependabot.yml), CodeQL analysis.

### 4️⃣ Strengthen Testing & Coverage

- **4.1 Expand Vitest unit tests** – add tests for critical UI components (ContactForm, Nav, ProjectCard).
- **4.2 Add Playwright E2E suite** – test each public page and the contact form flow.
- **4.3 Generate coverage reports** – ensure yarn test:coverage outputs HTML and is uploaded in CI.
- **4.4 Example test snippets** are included in src/**tests**/ folder.

#### 4.5 Improve test coverage (detailed plan)
Goal: Bring overall coverage to a reliable minimum of 60% across statements, functions, branches, and lines, focusing on critical libraries, API routes, and UI components.

Steps:
1. Audit current coverage
   - Run `yarn test:coverage` locally and upload/inspect the `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` to identify files with low coverage.
   - Prioritize files that affect correctness and user-facing behavior: `src/lib/*`, `src/app/api/*`, `src/contexts/*`, and key components (TopNavbar, ContactForm, calculators).

2. Add tests for core libraries (High priority)
   - Add unit tests for `src/lib/cutOptimizer.ts` (validation, edge cases, utilities, and algorithm behavior).
   - Add tests for formatting/utility functions (describe, format helpers).
   - Add tests for any other business logic-heavy libraries.

3. Add route & API unit tests (High priority)
   - Add tests for `src/app/api/mongo-crud/route.ts` to verify validation (collection name checks), auth guard behaviour, and error paths.
   - Mock database operations (use `vi.mock` on `src/app/api/mongo-crud/route` internals or mock `mongodb` interactions) for mutating behaviour tests.

4. Strengthen component tests (Medium priority)
   - Add Vitest + React Testing Library tests for interactive components (ContactForm, TopNavbar, calculators) covering user flows, validation, and accessibility expectations.
   - Make tests deterministic (minimal reliance on CSS classnames or layout; prefer data-testid and ARIA roles).

5. Add Playwright E2E visual checkpoints (Medium priority)
   - Add PoC visual tests (e.g., ResultsDisplay PoC already added).
   - Create baselines for critical pages (home, about, contact, cut-calculator) and integrate into CI as optional gating (for main branch enforcement).

6. Enforce coverage thresholds & CI (High priority)
   - Configure Vitest coverage thresholds (60%) in `vitest.config.ts`.
   - Ensure CI runs `yarn vitest run --coverage` and uploads coverage artifacts (already in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
   - Fail the CI job if coverage falls below thresholds.

7. Ongoing maintenance (Low priority)
   - Add tests to PR checklist and require new features to include tests.
   - Schedule a monthly coverage review to add tests in lower-coverage areas.

Acceptance criteria:
- `yarn test:coverage` completes and coverage meets thresholds (>= 60% for lines, functions, branches, statements).
- Critical libraries (cutOptimizer, API routes, ContactForm) are covered by deterministic tests.
- CI uploads coverage artifacts and fails on coverage regressions.

Status: In Progress — vitest coverage thresholds added; unit tests added for `cutOptimizer` (validation + algorithm + utilities), `ContactForm` (validation & submission flows), and `mongo-crud` (validation + auth guard + mocked mutation flows). Next: expand component tests (TopNavbar, Page layout), add tests for contexts (Auth, Navbar), and add accessibility-focused unit tests for critical pages. After that, iterate until `yarn test:coverage` meets thresholds.

### 5️⃣ Documentation & Onboarding

- **5.1 Add README badges** (CI, Node, License).
- **5.2 Create CONTRIBUTING.md** with workflow checklist.
- **5.3 Add CODEOWNERS** to assign ownership of src/**.
- **5.4 Mirror essential BookStack pages into docs/ folder (setup, architecture, migration notes).
- **5.5 Optional**: set up a static docs site (Docusaurus or MkDocs).

### 6️⃣ Security & Secrets Management

- **6.1 Enforce secrets via GitHub Actions** – move any .env values to repository secrets.
- **6.2 Add a pre‑commit hook** to warn when .env* files are staged.
- **6.3 Enable Dependabot alerts** and add dependabot.yml.
- **6.4 Add CodeQL workflow** for static analysis.

### 7️⃣ Performance & SEO Optimizations

- **7.1 Replace raw <img> tags with Next.js <Image> component.
- **7.2 Verify Tailwind purge configuration (content paths include all .tsx files).
- **7.3 Run bundle analyzer (next build && npx next-bundle-analyzer).
- **7.4 Ensure ISR for marketing pages (revalidate: 60).

### 8️⃣ Project Management & Roadmap Visibility

- **8.1 Create TODO.md (this file) summarizing milestones.
- **8.2 Link TODO.md from the README under “Current Work & Roadmap”.
- **8.3 Enable GitHub Projects and pin the board to the repo.

### 9️⃣ Optional Developer Experience Boosts & High Priority Actions

- **9.1 Integrate Playwright visual/E2E tests into CI.**
- **9.2 Husky + lint‑staged for auto‑format on commit.**
- **9.3 VSCode DevContainer for reproducible environment.**
- **9.4 Consider TurboRepo/pnpm if the repo ever splits into packages.**

High priority audits & improvements (merged)

- **Audit Netlify usage** — search for `/.netlify/functions/`, `netlify-identity-widget`, `netlify.toml`, and `public/__forms.html`. Document call sites and list migration steps.
- **Improve ESLint config** — implement Next.js recommended config (flat config if possible), ensure TypeScript rule coverage and autofix in CI.
  - Owner: @dev
  - Acceptance: ESLint runs in CI with no TODO fallbacks and applies safe autofixes.
- **Harden tests & mocks** — replace global zod mocks with `vi.mock(importOriginal(...))` or the real zod library where appropriate and add deterministic test utilities.
  - Owner: @dev
  - Acceptance: Tests pass reliably in CI and locally without brittle global state.
- **Accessibility audit & fixes (In Progress)**
  - Owner: @dev
  - Acceptance: Axe critical/serious violations are resolved; add Vitest-based axe checks and a CI job to fail on critical violations.
  - Plan:
    1. Add Vitest/axe checks for core pages (home, contact, projects).
    2. Fix the top accessibility issues discovered and add regression tests.
    3. Expand checks across routes and add CI a11y job.
- **Metadata & social previews** — add OG/Twitter metadata, canonical URLs, and a script to optionally generate OG images for posts.
- **Integration tests for API routes** — use MongoMemoryServer for CI-backed integration tests.
  - Owner: @dev
  - Acceptance: Integration job runs reliably in CI and cleans up test DBs.
- **Dependabot & Security** — triage GH security alerts and create upgrade PRs for critical/high vulnerabilities.
  - Owner: @security
- **Staging & rollout** — deploy to a staging host, run E2E/integration tests, validate, then remove Netlify artifacts.
- **CI thresholds & gating** — enforce coverage and lint thresholds to fail PRs when regressions occur.
- **Docs & README updates** — ensure README, `NextjsRefactor.md` and docs reflect auth choice, deployment docs, and env variables.
- **Cleanup unused dependencies** — remove unused packages and confirm CI passes and lockfile updates.
- **Remove temporary test patterns** — ensure tests are non-interactive and stable in CI.

- Implement API route handler replacement for mongoCrud ✅
  - `src/app/api/mongo-crud/route.ts` added using Next.js Route Handlers (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE).
  - Uses a shared MongoClient with connection caching to avoid reconnecting on hot reload.
  - Input validation added with `zod` and an environment-based allowlist (`ALLOWED_COLLECTIONS`). ✅
  - Server-side auth validation added for mutating operations using Clerk (`auth()` from `@clerk/nextjs`) — POST/PUT/DELETE require authenticated user. ✅
  - Unit tests added (Vitest) for validation and auth edge cases. ✅

- Netlify Forms hardening and tests ✅
  - Playwright E2E test added to simulate contact form submission against a running dev server (intercepts `/__forms.html` and asserts success UI). ✅
  - CI runs Playwright E2E tests against a built site (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` e2e job). ✅
  - Confirm `public/__forms.html` stays in sync with UI fields and honeypot name (netlify-honeypot="bot-field"). ✅ (unit test added to assert client POST behavior)

- CI pipeline
  - Add a GitHub Actions workflow to run: install, lint, test, TypeDoc, and build on pushes and PRs.
  - Upload build output and TypeDoc as artifacts for debugging.

- Dependency audit ✅
  - Removed `react-dropzone` and `react-paginate` from `package.json` (no usages in `src/`).
  - Remaining likely-unused packages (`react-chartjs-2`, `chart.js`, `open-iconic`) were left in lockfiles but not in `package.json`; plan to remove if truly unused in follow-up PRs.
  - Keep `bson-objectid`, `md5`, and MongoDB driver (used).

- Docs & internal guides
  - Update `NextjsRefactor.md` to reflect App Router, MDX, AuthContext, and current Netlify integrations; remove pages/* and next-auth references.
  - Ensure `readme.md` “Technologies and Tools” reflects the final auth choice after the Auth plan decision.
  - Confirm TypeDoc scope: exclude tests (`*.test.tsx` done), ensure only public APIs are documented.

- Config and DX
  - Revisit `tsconfig.json` for alignment with Next.js recommendations; consider raising target (ES2020+) and relying on Next’s defaults.
  - Ensure ESLint runs type-aware checks; consider adding stricter rules incrementally with autofix.
  - Add environment variable documentation and `.env.example` once the hosting/auth plan is finalized (keys: MONGODB_URI, DB_NAME, others).

**New Highest Priority: Fix merge conflicts & get CI green** ✅

- Marked: **In Progress**
- Sub-steps:
  1. Resolve remaining merge conflicts (search for `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>` across the repo).
  2. Run `yarn install` and `yarn build` locally; capture TypeScript/lint/test failures.
  3. Fix TypeScript and ESLint failures incrementally, adding small tests where behavior changed.
  4. Re-generate lockfile (if dependency changes) and commit `package.json` + `yarn.lock` updates atomically.
  5. Run CI locally (via `yarn test` + `yarn lint`) and ensure Playwright/Vitest jobs pass.
  6. Push fixes, open PR, and post this plan in the PR description with verification steps.

## Recent Update (2026-01-20) ✅

- Build & TypeScript fixes:
  - Resolved the blocking TypeScript errors (removed missing `AlgorithmType`, aligned `calculateOptimalCuts` call to `CutCalculatorInput`, fixed `Popover` prop spreads and Vitest coverage config).
  - Added a Clerk fallback in `AuthProvider`/`layout` so prerendering won't fail when `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is missing.
  - Local production build now completes after these fixes.

- Tailwind migration status:
  - Tailwind base and `postcss` config are in place; many unknown `@apply` utilities were replaced with explicit rules to unblock build.
  - Per-component SCSS modules remain and are being migrated incrementally (next priority).

Tailwind Migration Todo (feature/tailwind branch)

- Convert `GradientHeroSection` to Tailwind `bg-gradient-to-b from-<color> to-<color>` and update usage to accept color tokens (done)
- Replace dropdown gradient background in `TopNavbar` with `bg-gradient-to-b` using Tailwind utilities (done)
- Add safelist entries to `tailwind.config.cjs` for `from-` / `to-` classes used dynamically (done)
- Add Playwright visual snapshot baselines for hero + navbar and confirm parity (todo)
- Replace remaining custom gradients and popover styles with Tailwind utilities where appropriate (todo)
- Remove unused SCSS and update migration docs after visual tests pass (todo)

## Component migration (Vitest-first)

**Goal:** Convert UI components to Tailwind and validate them with Vitest unit tests and Playwright visual snapshots before integrating them into pages. This reduces visual regression risk and ensures behavior and accessibility parity.

High-level steps:

1. Identify components still using Bootstrap/legacy SCSS and convert them to Tailwind-first implementations.
2. Add comprehensive inline documentation (file header + key block comments) that describe purpose, rationale, and testing approach.
3. Add Vitest unit tests for each component covering behavior and accessibility edge cases.
4. Add Playwright visual snapshot tests for key components/pages (hero, navbar, cut calculator).
5. Remove the `Compat/BootstrapShim` and any remaining Bootstrap artifacts once tests and visual comparisons confirm parity.
6. Update repository docs (`readme.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `Tailwind Migration` docs) to reflect the Vitest-first workflow and Playwright-based visual testing approach.

Acceptance criteria:

- All previously Bootstrap-dependent components have Vitest unit tests and Playwright visual snapshots where applicable.
- Visual diffs are intentional and documented; Playwright visual snapshots are added to CI for critical pages/components.
- `Compat/BootstrapShim` is removed and no Bootstrap imports remain.
- Documentation updated with the Vitest-first workflow and Tailwind-first guidance.

Owners & Timeline:

- Owner: @dev
- Target: Small batches, mergeable PRs (1-3 components per PR). Aim to complete initial set (cut calculator components) in a single sprint (~1 week).

Detailed per-component sub-steps (repeat for each component):

- Identify file(s) and any dependent child components.
- Add a top-of-file comment with purpose, rationale for Tailwind-first approach, and usage examples.
- Convert markup to Tailwind (remove shim or react-bootstrap usage).
- Add `*.stories.tsx` in `src/stories/<component>.<stories>` with knobs for props and test data.
- Add a small unit test (Vitest) for the component's behavior and a Storybook snapshot or Playwright visual snapshot.
- Run `yarn build` and `yarn test` locally and in CI; fix any type or accessibility regressions.
- Remove shim import and update callers.

### Status: Work in progress — partial completion ✅

Completed (recent):

- Cut calculator components converted to Tailwind: `CutRequirementsTable`, `StockItemsTable`, `ResultsDisplay` (stories & unit tests added). ✅
- Replaced usage of `react-bootstrap` with Tailwind in services and cut calculator pages. ✅
- Removed `Compat/BootstrapShim` and deleted `clsx` dependency. ✅
- README and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` updated to document the Vitest-first workflow. ✅

Open / next tasks (small incremental PRs):

1. Add Playwright visual snapshot baselines for the three cut-calculator components and integrate Storybook visual snapshots into CI. (In progress)
2. Fix failing Vitest suites unrelated to Tailwind migration (stability & environment shims) so the CI test run is reliable. (High priority)
3. Continue converting remaining components that still used legacy SCSS or Bootstrap and add stories/tests as described.
4. Update `TAILWIND-MIGRATION-PLAN.md` with the final list of removed SCSS files and any tokens mapping.

- Cleanup performed (2026-01-20):
  - Removed generated agent and prompt markdowns and one obsolete issue that were imported for Next.js/MCP experiments: `.github/prompts/*`, `.github/agents/*`, `.github/ISSUES/007-tailwind-migration.md`.

- Next steps (priority):
  1. Finish per-component SCSS → Tailwind conversions and remove legacy SCSS imports. 🔧
  2. Run visual regression / Playwright snapshots to confirm parity. 🧪
  3. Finalize deployment plan & remove remaining Netlify-specific artifacts once ready. 🚀
  4. Confirm CI (lint/tests/a11y/e2e) passes and open PRs for incremental migrations.

> If you'd like, I can also remove related dev dependencies that were specifically added for MCP experiments — I didn't find new package additions tied to those markdowns, so nothing required there unless you want to prune additional unused packages.
